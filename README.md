# AvatarID Demo

AvatarID is a decentralized set of custom avatar protocols provided by Lifeform, and it allows users to customize their unique WEB3 avatars by holding NFTs (either 721 or 1155). In any EVM-compatible public blockchain environment, it is possible to obtain information about a user's avatar assets on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network or test network simply by using the user's address.
